//- I use this datalink variable to quickly switch between using local assets and using uploaded assets. 
//- For example, say I am uploading files to http://data.baltimoresun.com/example-link
//- If I wanted to switch quickly to my local files, instead of changing all of my links, 
//- I can just modify this single variable.
//- There are two datalink variables so I don't have to rewrite the link every time. 
//- The second datalink variable declaration overwrites the first one. 
//- When I want to switch to my server assets, I comment out the second declaration.

					span On the moring of August 1, 2015 
					| police officers went to Gaines' apartment to serve an arrest warrant on Gaines for her alleged failure to appear in court after a traffic stop in March. In Baltimore, one of every three people struck by gunfire dies, up from one death in every four shootings the previous decade. It ranks as one of the most lethal of America's largest cities, according to a Baltimore Sun analysis. Two other cities — Washington and New Orleans — shared the brutal distinction of one in three shootings ending in a homicide in 2015. Like Baltimore, several cities have seen the death grip tighten. In Chicago, one in 10 people died after being shot in 2000; now one in six perishes.
